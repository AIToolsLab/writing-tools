						<p>
							Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai, are applied to many writing tasks and seem like a “magic
							tool” due to advanced reasoning capabilities, but there isn’t much variety in the interfaces used to request
							their outputs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The typical “chat” interface often provides a single, seemingly final answer, which can make users overestimate
							LLM capabilities and assume its answer is the “best” answer. But we don’t know what really “goes into” an LLM’s
							training, so we want to help users become more aware of possible limitations.

				<h2>Approaches</h2>
				<div>
					<div>
						<p>
							We developed a Microsoft Word sidebar that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different ways:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="gtype-desc"><strong>Completion of a current thought:</strong> Provides a pre-written single sentence</li>
							<li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A question about current/future writing:</strong> A question the writer could answer in
								the next sentence</li>
							<li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A list of possible vocabulary:</strong> to use in the next sentence</li>
							<li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A rhetorical strategy to employ:</strong> Directions on the kind of sentence to write,
								like citing statistics, offering a personal anecdote, etc.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					In a pilot study (N=9), writers found questions and rhetorical moves to be useful and friendly. Multiple
					participants
					found that the suggestions helped overcome “writer’s block” and characterized the tool as
					conversational or collaborative. Although writers chose to request "Completion" more often, they often rejected the
					suggested text. The majority of participants used the “Completions” option most often, and expressed reservation on
					how their usage of “Completions” affected their authorship and ownership of the text, but did not raise similar
					objections to other suggestion types. Dissonance between conscious desire for originality and subconscious desire to minimize
					cognitive load.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, non-Completion type suggestions seem to hold the most promise in assisting—but not replacing—users’
					writing; completions did help with writer’s block when it was aligned with what users wanted to say, but also sometimes
					induced writers’ block when suggesting ideas that weren’t aligned. This demonstrates the potential for more open-ended
					suggestions to fill this gap.
				</p>
				<p>
					Multiple participants rejected more at the beginning then noticed the LLM got a better sense of what they were going
					for later on, suggesting they were cognitively engaged in evaluating the appropriateness of LLM outputs.
				</p>

				<h2>Future Work</h2>
				<p>
					On the research end, we plan to further compare writers’ usage of our prototype suggestions, make connections to
					existing literature, iterate on our current study design for the eventual deployment study, and debrief with the
					development team on opportunities for additional functionality or affordances.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the development end, we plan to finalize DevOps and deploy our application to Azure, publish to Microsoft Store to run usability tests,
					iterate on the design of the sidebar, improve the quality of the suggestions, and improve robustness of our system.

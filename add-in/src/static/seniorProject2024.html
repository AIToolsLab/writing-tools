              For the past few years, this research has focused on developing assistive applications of (large) language models to
              enhance users’ writing without replacing it. Broadly, these applications can be categorized either as AI-generated
              feedback for the revision stage of writing or as AI-generated recommendations for the initial drafting stage of
              writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, we aim to further this work in four ways: analyzing user study results for use in an academic paper report,
              drawing on the report’s findings to improve user experience, designing a longitudinal study with these improvements,
              and integrating revision and drafting features into a single app deployed on the Microsoft Store.

            <li class="gtype-desc">How does constraining LLM generations to single-sentence completions affect how people use

              writing?</li>
            <li class="gtype-desc">How do further constraints to those single-sentence completions—such as constraining output
              to key words or turning the
              completion into a question—affect how people use AI-generated text in their writing? </li>
            <li class="gtype-desc">How might any of these completions be applicable to the revision stage of writing?</li>
            <li class="gtype-desc">How should we integrate AI-generated feedback and AI-generated completions into a single
              cohesive tool?</li>

              We developed a Microsoft Word sidebar that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different
              ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>Completion of a current thought:</strong> Provides a pre-written single
                sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A question about current/future writing:</strong> A question the writer could
                answer in
                the next sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A list of possible vocabulary:</strong> to use in the next sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A rhetorical strategy to employ:</strong> Directions on the kind of sentence
                to write,
                like citing statistics, offering a personal anecdote, etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Progress so far</h2>
        <p>
          In a pilot study (N=9), writers found questions and rhetorical moves to be useful and friendly.
          After the pilot study, we worked on coding 9 transcript logs from our user studies, which essentially means categorizing
          user feedback by topic and theme for analysis. We’ve finished a first pass on all the transcripts and have begun writing our analysis based on a widely
          cited process-oriented model of writing, focusing on how suggestions might play a role in the various stages of the
          writing process. At a broad level we found that users find abstract prompts more useful than individual words or turns
          of phrase. From a process-based perspective, this suggests that writers can gain the most from AI assistance during the pre-translation
          phase—that is, before they put an idea into words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our development team has been working on integrating previous works, as well as improving the robustness of our system.
          We pulled over all previous works into a single Microsoft Word add-in, and migrated our backend to use Azure Services
          for better scalability and reliability. We implemented logging to track user interactions with our interface,
          which is stored in our Azure Table Storage.
          Finally, we implemented authentication (OAuth) to allow users to sign in to our add-in using their thrid-party accounts.

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
          On the research end, we plan to further compare writers’ usage of our prototype suggestions, make connections to
          existing literature, iterate on our current study design for the eventual deployment study, and debrief with the
          development team on opportunities for additional functionality or affordances.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the development end, we plan to finalize DevOps and deploy our application to Azure, publish to Microsoft
          Store to run usability tests,
          iterate on the design of the sidebar, improve the quality of the suggestions, and improve robustness of our
          system.

    Generate three distinct, inspiring suggestions to help a writer continue crafting their document, tailored to the precise location of their writing cursor. You will receive:

    - The writer's complete document.
    - The segment of text immediately preceding the writer's cursor.

    Follow these guidelines for each mode:

    - If the writer is at the very beginning (no substantial text yet), suggest three different ways to open the document.
    - If the writer has just finished a sentence at the cursor, suggest three potential next sentences, each fresh and unique, respecting the established context.
    - If the writer’s cursor is in the middle of a sentence, suggest three possible continuations for that sentence.
    - All three suggestions should be specific, plausible continuations at the cursor location (do not sequence them), grounded in the document’s context, tone, and genre.
    - Make each suggestion distinct in content (not just wording).
    - Each suggestion should be at most one sentence and no more than about 20 words. Use ellipses to truncate as needed.

    Output the three suggestions using this JSON structure:

    {
      "suggestions": [
        {"content": "[suggestion 1]"},
        {"content": "[suggestion 2]"},
        {"content": "[suggestion 3]"}
      ]
    }

    ## Reasoning and Output Order

    - Reason first: Carefully analyze the document and cursor context, and consider tone, style, and narrative goals before generating suggestions.
    - Provide the JSON output only after fully reasoning through possibilities.

    ## Additional Considerations

    - Before producing suggestions, always analyze where the cursor is and the nature of the preceding text.
    - Never provide suggestions that repeat or simply rephrase one another.
    - Make use of ellipses (...) to truncate longer sentences for clarity.
    - Structure output exactly as per the provided JSON, unwrapped and formatted as shown.

    **REMINDER:**
    - Always analyze document and cursor location first, then suggest three distinct, context-sensitive, 1-sentence ideas as JSON (never in sequence), each ≤20 words, using ellipses if needed.

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Current AI influence analysis is purely LLM-based. Add quantitative text similarity metrics (e.g., n-gram overlap, embedding similarity) to complement LLM judgment.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Add n-gram overlap calculation between suggestions and final text
- [ ] #2 Add embedding-based similarity score
- [ ] #3 Compare quantitative vs LLM-based influence scores
<!-- AC:END -->

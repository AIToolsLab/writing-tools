**Study title**: AI for Supporting Independent Writing

**Researchers**: Kenneth C. Arnold, Ph.D., Jooha (Hannah) Yoo, Alina Sainju, Jiho Kim, Jason Chew

**1. Introduction**

We invite you to participate in a study exploring the design of AI writing assistants. Participation in the study is entirely voluntary. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to discuss them with the primary investigator, Kenneth C. Arnold, Ph.D. (see Section 10). If you decide to take part, you will sign this form to signify your consent to participate in the study as outlined below.

**2. Purpose of the Study**

The purpose of this study is to investigate how AI systems might facilitate independent writing.

**3. Procedures**

Your participation entails performing a writing task using a system that offers AI-generated suggestions. The study itself will be conducted asynchronously via a website accessed through Prolific. Please see Section 7 for more detail on how your data will be handled.

**4. Time Duration**

Participating in this study will take 20-30 minutes.

**5. Discomforts and Risks**

We do not anticipate any discomforts or risks from participating in this study.

**6. Potential Benefits**

Your participation in this study may benefit future users of our software and contribute to scientific knowledge about how AI can influence the process of writing.

**7. Statement of Confidentiality**

We will be collecting several types of data from your participation in this study, including records of how you interact with the AI writing tool and samples of your writing. Selections from your writing, along with AI-generated outputs, will be logged and stored on a secure server accessible only to our research team.

Please be aware that during your participation in this study, portions of your writing will be sent to third-party service providers such as OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic to request outputs from their AI services. We require that service providers guarantee confidentiality of the data sent to them and that they promise not to use that data to train their AI models or otherwise improve their services.

The data you provide will be stored in a secure storage location on our servers, Microsoft cloud services including SharePoint, and on a qualitative analysis tool such as Delve. These platforms enable our research team to safely store, organize, share, and access the data in a private and collaborative environment, accessible only to the investigators. Your data will be stored in password-protected files and services accessible only to the researchers. In the unlikely event of a technical problem with the files, the researchers may grant software technical support staff temporary access to the files. In such cases, technical support staff will access the files solely to resolve the technical problem. Once issues are resolved, the researchers will revoke the technical support staff’s access to the files.

Results of this study will be shared in academic publications and presentations. These results may include quotes from participants and samples of the system’s input and output, but we will ensure that quotes do not identify you.

**8. Compensation for Participation**

Participants will receive $5 for their time completing this study.

**9. Voluntary Participation**

Your participation is entirely voluntary. You may decline to participate without penalty, withdraw at any time without penalty, and request deletion of your data.

**10. Contact Information of the Primary Investigator**

If you have questions about this research or if you think you have been harmed by participating, you may contact Professor Kenneth C. Arnold, Department of Computer Science, Calvin University, by email at ken.arnold@calvin.edu, by phone at 616-526-8723, or by mail at 3201 Burton St SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546.

**11. Institutional Review Board Approval**

The Calvin University Institutional Review Board has approved this study. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or wish to obtain information, ask questions or discuss any concerns about this study with someone other than the researcher(s), please contact the Calvin University Institutional Review Board Committee at Office of the Provost, Calvin University, 3201 Burton St SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546, irb@calvin.edu.

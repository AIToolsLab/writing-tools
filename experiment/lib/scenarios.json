Each message is a string. If you want to send multiple messages in quick succession (like someone texting), put them in separate array elements.\n\nExample: [\"1pm same room 😅\", \"can you email him?\"]\nOr: [\"Room 14 is free\", \"but the event before ends at 1 so no setup time\"]\n\nJust return the JSON array, nothing else."

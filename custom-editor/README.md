# Getting started
- Clone repo
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

----------
# Development:
- If you're importing something from a file, `@` is the `./src` directory
- `yarn run lint --fix` to fix (almost) all lint errors
- Currently, the app is using the backend server from `/backend` in the root project directory

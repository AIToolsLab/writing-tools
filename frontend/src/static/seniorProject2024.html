            <p>
              Under the guidance of Dr. Ken Arnold, the Thoughtful AI lab conducts research into applications of large language models (LLMs)
              which enhance—but do not replace—the users’ writing. Our lab focuses on two categories of these applications: AI-generated
              feedback for the revision stage of writing and AI-generated recommendations for the drafting stage of writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, we aim to further this work in four ways: publishing an analysis of prior user studies,
              utilizing the report’s findings to improve user experience, designing a longitudinal study with the improved system,
              and integrating revision/drafting features into a single app published on the Microsoft Store.

            <li class="question-desc">How does constraining LLM generations to single-sentence completions affect how people use

            <li class="question-desc">How do further constraints to those single-sentence completions—such as constraining output
              to key words or turning the
              completion into a question—affect how people use AI-generated text in their writing? </li>
            <li class="question-desc">How might any of these completions be applicable to the revision stage of writing?</li>
            <li class="question-desc">How should we integrate AI-generated feedback and AI-generated completions into a single
              cohesive tool?</li>

              We developed a Microsoft Word sidebar that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different
              ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>Completion of a current thought:</strong> provides a single pre-written
                sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A question about current/future writing:</strong> a question the writer could
                answer in the next sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A list of possible vocabulary:</strong> vocabulary to use in the next sentence</li>
              <li class="gtype-desc"><strong>A rhetorical strategy to employ:</strong> directions on the kind of sentence
                to write, such as citing statistics, offering a personal anecdote, incorporating a counterargument, etc.</li>

        <h2>Progress So Far</h2>
        <p>
          After conducting a pilot study with N=9 participants, we coded each of the resulting transcript logs to categorize
          user feedback by topic and theme. Generally, participants found questions and rhetorical moves to be useful and friendly, and
          found abstract prompts more useful than individual words or turns of phrase. We intend to further contextualize these findings
          in process-oriented writing theory to evaluate how suggestions might play a role in various stages of the
          writing process. Current analysis suggests that writers can gain the most from AI assistance during the pre-translation
          phase—that is, before they put an idea into words.
        </p>
        <p>
          In tandem with this research, project development has continued with a focus on integrating previous works, finalizing DevOps, and improving the
          robustness of our system. All prior functionality is now merged into a single Microsoft Word add-in, and its backend migrated
          onto Azure Services for better scalability and reliability. We also implemented authentication (OAuth) to allow users to
          sign in to our add-in using their third-party accounts. Currently, we are in the process of publishing our application to the Microsoft Store.

Text editor with sidebar that has an AI conversation about the document. When the writer sends a message, the current state of the document (including what text is around the cursor) is also sent in the conversation (maybe the user chat message and the document text are given in separate XML-ish tags for the LLM). The AI is given tools to show visualizations in ASCII art, Mermaid, or plain Markdown (e.g., for a hierarchical outline or presentation slides). To start, the user presses a button to request that the AI suggest visualizations of the document content that could help them allocate their attention in their writing. The AI then responds with brief descriptions of 3 or more possible visualizations that it could make, and maybe some clarifying questions about the rhetorical situation if needed. Then the writer responds with a what visualization they desire (one of those or something different). The AI then generates that visualization.

The visualizations should include references to specific parts of the document. When the user clicks on that part of the visualization, the corresponding part of the document should highlight. When the user clicks in the document, the part of the visualization with a document reference closest to the text that's near the cursor should be highlighted, so the visualization is interactive and two way.

The AI should be very careful to ground its observations and visualizations in the specific content of the document, not generic things.
